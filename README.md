# HistoriCull-game

A dark fantasy dungeon crawler based on real-world history, historic sites and major actors with healthy addition of dark myth.  
You explore fragmented historic locations, confront twisted versions of famous figures, and uncover a hidden narrative buried in forgotten timelines.

## 🎯 Vision
Create a modular dungeon experience where each “room” is inspired by a real historic site or city.  
Each boss is a corrupted version of a real-world historical person and helps you uncover their story or the major events of their lifetime, while allowing you to learn naturally.
The base is still a tried and true 2D dungeon crawler, as of now undecided between the party and the singular character model.
